1. It is necessary to provide the correct paths in src/main/resources/application.properties for where to read the raw
data sets and where to write the pre-processed data sets. Specifically, you need to change the variables

processed.data.dir=/Users/sahandzarrinkoub/School/year5/thesis/datasets/preprocessed_datasets_nqtitles/
stopwords.path=/Users/sahandzarrinkoub/School/year5/thesis/datasets/datasets/stopwords.txt
naturalQuestions.raw.home=/Users/sahandzarrinkoub/School/year5/thesis/datasets/datasets/nq/
quora.raw.home=/Users/sahandzarrinkoub/School/year5/thesis/datasets/datasets/quora/
reuters.raw.home=/Users/sahandzarrinkoub/School/year5/thesis/datasets/datasets/reuters/
squad.raw.home=/Users/sahandzarrinkoub/School/year5/thesis/datasets/datasets/squad/
wikiQA.raw.home=/Users/sahandzarrinkoub/School/year5/thesis/datasets/datasets/wikiqa/

These all have to be changed to correct paths on the environment you're on. Here's some more info about each property
listed above.

processed.data.dir is the folder where all the pre-processed data sets will end up. You can choose this freely, but
remember that you have to point to the data sets in this folder when you are training the models in the
https://github.com/Sahand1993/thesis.git repo.

stopwords.path must point to a stopwords file.

All other properties (the ones that end with ".raw.home") are paths to the raw data sets.


2. You must also have docker installed and run mysql docker-start-mysq-database.sh to initialize the database used by
Rcv1ArticlesDatabaseWriter (and other database writers although they are not used in this version of the preprocessor)

When you have your database you need to provide the correct credentials in the properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST:localhost}:3306/datasets
spring.datasource.username=preprocessor
spring.datasource.password=preprocessor

in src/main/resources/applications.properties.
